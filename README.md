# This example has been replaced by the [Firebase Queue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-queue) NPM module

Please check out the new repository for a more comprehensive, robust framework on which to build a task queue powered by Firebase

### firebase-work-queue - A Simple Firebase Queue
===================

This is an example of processing data using Firebase as a queuing system.

To run, first you'll need to install the Firebase node package:
    
    npm install firebase

To process elements in the work queue, start a worker like this:

    node worker.js

To add new elements to the work queue, start the generator, like this:
    
    node generator.js

You can start as many workers or generators as you like. The WorkQueue uses transactions to ensure that each job is only given to one worker.
